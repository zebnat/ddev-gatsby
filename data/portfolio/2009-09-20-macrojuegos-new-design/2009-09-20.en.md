# Revamp & upgrade macrojuegos.com with a new design

I was hired by Panaworld S.L part-time in order to support development tasks, frontend, layouts, HTML, CSS and not much else. My first job with this company was revamping their main product with a new design, macrojuegos.com.

This kind of work was basically writting HTML code and CSS2.5 rules in order to support browsers like Internet Explorer 6, 7, 8, Mozilla Firefox, and the newborn Google Chrome. The design was made by a professional designer with Adobe Photoshop, and i just had to convert it to a real static website.

This was my first programming job, althrough HTML & CSS is not really programming (but can be even harder sometimes). The website was about browser games, mini-games, and it had a lot of traffic. Also, they had multilingual support, althrough this was not a problem for the upgrade.

Once finished, we published it only on the lowest traffic domain, from English, Russian, and polish languages. minigamers.com macrogames.ru microgry.com.

These days, HTML & CSS may be simpler, but back in 2009 with all the old browsers out there, it was really a problem, giving you headaches. Why? because you followed the rules of the official documentation of CSS2 & HTML but the browser behaved as he wanted. Luckily the users upgraded theirs browsers leaving Internet Explorer in a second and even third place. Chrome is today the king.
